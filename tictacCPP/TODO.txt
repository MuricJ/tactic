TODO:

1. Optimize away symmetry
2. Unit testing
3. Multithreading
4. Implement minimax + try combining
5. Library fror experiments
6. Reduce number of memory allocations, adjust memory model for multithreading
7. Maybe remove state from nodes except leaf nodes? Depends on memory and multithreading model
8. Also count losses in MCTS for a possibly more accurate eval metric
